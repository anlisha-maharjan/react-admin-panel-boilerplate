## About

The project is a React Admin Panel boilerplate that provides an architecture optimized for building solid web app with embedded authentication flow to help you kickstart new app.

When starting new app I found myself repeatedly setting up my project with same packages over and over again so I decided to automate this process.

While this mostly consists of how I organize my projects but can be easily extended to suit any workflow.

Feel free to leave a ‚≠ê as motivation if this was useful to you üòä
